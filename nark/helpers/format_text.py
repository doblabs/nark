# (lb): This function differs from textwrap/ansiwrap.shorten in at least two respects:
# - It truncates regardless of whitespace, i.e., inside words, e.g., "it'll trunca...".
# - It replaces each newline with its escape sequence ("\n"), to provide more context,
#   while also avoiding line breakages.

        if len(val) > trunc_width and trunc_width >= 0:

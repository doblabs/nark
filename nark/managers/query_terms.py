        # - There's code wired to 'delete' an Activity, but what does that mean?
        # - Really, the user should be able to 'orphan' an Activity (by removing
        #   it from all Facts), but if an Activity is still being used by Facts,
        #   what would delete do? Would we want to remove the Activity from all
        #   the Facts it's applied to?
        #   - I think an 'orphaned' option makes sense here. And maybe a feature
        #     to "rename" an Activity, or really to assign a different Activity
        #     to some collection of Facts. Then maybe 'delete' is okay, i.e.,
        #     once a Activity is orphaned, then it can be deleted.
        #   - In the meantime, the user can hide Activities from the CLI front
        #     end using the ignore feature, which omits matching Activities
        #     from the auto-complete and suggestion widgets.
        # In any case, this 'deleted' option is still wired in the CLI, so

        #     in the middle of the Activity name.

        #   complicated and useless does that sound.
        # - (lb): I added grouping support to FactManager.get_all via the options:
        #     group_activity
        #     group_category
        #     group_tags
        #   We could add them to this query, but it'd make it much more complex,
        #   and you'd get essentially the same results as using Fact.get_all (save
        #   for any Activities that are not applied to any Facts, but we can live
        #   with that gap in support). (tl;dr, use `dob list fact` or `dob usage fact`
        #   to group query results, and use the --column option if you want to tweak
        #   the output report columns, e.g., to match this method's output.)

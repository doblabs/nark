        # - Really, the user should be able to 'orphan' an Activity (by removing
        #   it from all Facts), but if an Activity is still being used by Facts,
        #   what would delete do? Would we want to remove the Activity from all
        #   the Facts it's applied to?
        #   - I think an 'orphaned' option makes sense here. And maybe a feature
        #     to "rename" an Activity, or really to assign a different Activity
        #     to some collection of Facts. Then maybe 'delete' is okay, i.e.,
        #     once a Activity is orphaned, then it can be deleted.
        #   - In the meantime, the user can hide Activities from the CLI front
        #     end using the ignore feature, which omits matching Activities
        #     from the auto-complete and suggestion widgets.

        """
        Configures query parameters for item.get_all() and item.get_all_by_usage().

        Some of the settings affect the query, and some affect the returned results.

        Each of the query parameters is optional. Defaults are such that each
        argument default is falsey: it's either False, None, or an empty list.

        Args:
            raw: If True, returns 'raw' SQLAlchemy items (e.g., AlchemyFact).
                If False, returns first-class nark objects (e.g., Fact).
            include_stats: If True, computes additional details for each item or set
                of grouped items, and returns a list of tuples (with the item or
                aggregated item as the first element). Otherwise, if False, returns
                a list of matching items only. For Attribute, Category, and Tag
                queries, enable include_stats to receive a count of Facts that use
                the item, as well as the cumulative duration (end - start) of those
                Facts. For Facts, includes additional aggregate details.

            count_results: If True, return only a count of query matches (an integer).
                By default, count_results is False, and the method returns a list of
                results (of either items or tuples, depending on include_stats).

            key: If specified, look for an item with this PK. See also the get()
                method, if you do not need aggregate results.
            since: Restrict Facts to those that start at or after this time.
            until: Restrict Facts to those that end at or before this time.
                Note that a query will *not* match any Facts that start before and
                end after (e.g. that span more than) the specified timeframe.

            endless: If True, include the active Fact, if any, in the query.
            exclude_ongoing: If True, excldues the active Fact, in any.
            partial: If True, restrict Facts to those that start or end within the
                since-to-until time window.
            deleted: If True, include items marked 'deleted'.
            search_term (None, or str list): Use to restrict to items whose name
                matches any on the specified search terms. Each comparison is case
                insensitive, and the match can occur in the middle of a string. If
                an item name matches one or more of the search terms, if any, it
                will be included in the results.
                * Use ``not`` before a search term to exclude its matches from the
                  results.

            activity (nark.Activity, str, or False; optional): Matches only the
                Activity or the Facts assigned the Activity with this exact name.
                The activity name can be specified as a string, or by passing a
                ``nark.Activity`` object whose name will be used. Defaults to
                ``False``, which skips the match. To match Facts without an
                Activity assigned, set ``activity=None``.
            match_activities: Use to specify more than one exact Activity name
                to match. Activities that exactly match any of the specified
                names will be included.
            category (nark.Category, str, or False; optional): Matches only the
                Category or the Activities assigned the Category with this exact
                name. The category name can be specified as a string, or by
                passing a ``nark.Caetgory`` object whose name will be used.
                Defaults to ``False``, which skips the match. To match Activities
                without a Category assigned, set ``category=None``.
            match_categories: Use to specify more than one exact Category name
                to match. Categories that exactly match any of the specified
                names will be included.

            group_activity: If True, GROUP BY the Activity name, unless group_category
                is also True, then GROUP BY the Activity PK and the Category PK.
            group_category: If True, GROUP BY the Category PK.
            group_tags: If True, group by the Tag PK.
            group_days: If True, group by the Fact start date (e.g., 1999-12-31,
                i.e., truncating clock time).

            sort_cols (str list, optional): Which column(s) to sort by.
                - If not aggregating results, defaults to 'name' and orders
                  by item name.
                - When aggregating results (include_stats=True) or searching
                  Facts, defaults to 'start', and orders results by Fact start.
                - Choices include: 'start', 'time', 'day', 'name', 'activity,
                  'category', 'tag', 'usage', and 'fact'.
                - Note that 'start' and 'usage' only apply if include_stats,
                  and 'day' is only valid when group_days is True.
            sort_orders (str list, optional): Specifies the direction of each
                sort specified by sort_cols. Use the string 'asc' or 'desc'
                in the corresponding index of sort_orders that you want applied
                to the corresponding entry in soft_cols. If there is no
                corresponding entry in sort_orders for a specific sort_cols
                entry, that sort column is ordered in ascending order.

            limit (int, optional): Query "limit".
            offset (int, optional): Query "offset".

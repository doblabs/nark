# Some of these are necessary, and some are just preferences.
# - E711 comparison to None should be 'if cond is None:'
#   (lb): SQLAlchemy filter function honors `== None`, not `is None`, e.g.,
#           query = query.filter(AlchemyFact.activity == None)
# - W391: blank line at end of file
#   (lb): Personal preference. So that, e.g., Ctrl-End is predictable and
#   goes to first column of last line, which is empty; as opposed to going
#   to some unknown last column of a nonempty last line.
# - W503 line break before binary operator
#   (lb): I'm with Knuth, for readability. Prefer this:
#       if (some_thing
#           and another):
#           and another_thing):
#     over this:
#       if (some_thing and
#           another and
#           another_thing):
# - W605 invalid escape sequence
#   (lb): Happening on regex, e.g., '\d{2}' getting flagged, how weird.
